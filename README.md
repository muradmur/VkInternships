# VkInternships

I had a finished project, a little time and a desire to do a task on the technical task for 
an internship in VK. This application is a demonstration of what I did. It was interesting to 
work with new things for me. I was already tired of working with bugs and I wanted to make my 
hands and write a project from scratch. I'm satisfied, thanks

The code base can be brought to the best state than now, I still wanted to work with Coordinationlayout, 
but I am now limited by time
